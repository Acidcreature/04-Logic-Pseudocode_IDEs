## Pseudocode, Logic, and Design

### For this lesson, we are going to cover several concepts derived from: "Programming Logic & Design, comprehensive", 9th edition. By Joyce Farrell ISBN-10: 1-337-10207-5, ISBN-13: 978-1-337-10207-0


## Objectives

**In this chapter, you will learn about:**

* Computer systems
* Simple program logic
* The steps involved in the program development cycle
* Pseudocode statements and flowchart symbols
* Using a sentinel value to end a program
* Programming and user environments
* The evolution of programming models

## Understanding Computer Systems

**Computer system**
Combination of all the components required to process and store data using a computer

* Hardware 
  * Equipment associated with a computer
* Software 
  * Computer instructions that tells the hardware what to do
  * Programs
    * Instructions written by programmers
  * Programming
    * Writing software instructions
  * Application software such as word processing, spreadsheets, payroll and inventory, even games, app
  * System software such as operating systems like Windows, Linux, or UNIX, Google Android and Apple IOS

**Computer hardware and software accomplish three major operations**
* Input
  * Data items such as text, numbers, images, and sound
* Processing
  * Calculations and comparisons performed by the central processing unit (CPU)
* Output 
  * Resulting information that is sent to a printer, a monitor, or storage devices after processing

**A cloud based device is accessed through the Internet**

**Programming language**
* Used to write computer instructions called program code
* Writing instructions is called coding the program
* Examples
  * Visual Basic, C#, C++, or Java
**Syntax**
  * Rules governing word usage and punctuation
  * Mistakes in a language’s usage are syntax errors

**Computer memory**
* Computer’s temporary, internal storage – random access memory (RAM)
* Volatile memory – lost when the power is off
**Permanent storage devices**
* Nonvolatile memory
**Compiler or interpreter**
* Translates source code into machine language (binary language) statements called object code
* Checks for syntax errors
**Program executes or runs**
* Input will be accepted, some processing will occur, and results will be output
**Programs with syntax errors cannot execute**
**Logical errors**
* Errors in program logic produce incorrect output
**Logic of the computer program**
* Sequence of specific instructions in specific order
**Variable** 
* Named memory location whose value can vary
**Program development cycle**
* Understand the problem
* Plan the logic
* Code the program
* Use software (a compiler or interpreter) to translate the program into machine language
* Test the program
* Put the program into production
* Maintain the program
